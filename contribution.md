## How to Contribute

## Suggested Contributions

- seeds (especially OpenFlow) extracted from real rule sets (e.g., using ClassBench-ng analyser)
- extension/reimplementation of original ClassBench's trace generator according to ClassBench-ng features (IPv4/IPv6 5-tuples, OpenFlow rules)
- support for alternative input formats in ClassBench-ng analyser
